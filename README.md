Homework Golang And SQL

In this code assignment we expect you to craft a simple solution as our requirement
below.

Build a minimal service to create, update, get, and delete movies, using this boilerplate.
- The system should receive an external GET request with movie slug, ex: titanic, return 200 (ok) if found and 404 (not found) if not found
- The system should receive an external POST request with create movie API contract, with status code 201 (created) if already successful to create. Movie slug must be unique
- The system should receive an external PUT request with slug as movie identifier alongside with update movie API contract and status code 200 (ok) if successfully update movie content, 400 (bad request) if there is a client error, 422 (unprocessable entity) if thereâ€™s a duplicate movie slug
- The system should receive an external DELETE request with slug as movie identifier return 200 (ok) if found and success to delete and 404 (not found) if the movie not found
- Solution should be running

Bonus:
- It will be a huge plus if add unit tests
- Add status code accordingly based on the errors
